All of the mechanisms discussed in the preceding sections
used one of a number of approaches to defer specific actions
until they may be carried out safely.
The reference counters discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:defer:Reference Counting}
use explicit counters to defer actions that could disturb readers,
which results in read-side contention and thus poor scalability.
The hazard pointers covered by
Section~\ref{sec:defer:Hazard Pointers}
uses implicit counters in the guise of per-thread lists of pointer.
This avoids read-side contention, but requires readers to do stores and
conditional branches, as well as either full memory barriers in read-side
primitives or real-time-unfriendly inter-processor interrupts in
update-side primitives.\footnote{
	In some important special cases, this extra work can be avoided
	by using link counting as exemplified by the UnboundedQueue
	and ConcurrentHashMap data structures implemented in Folly
	open-source library
	(\url{https://github.com/facebook/folly}).}
The sequence lock presented in
Section~\ref{sec:defer:Sequence Locks}
also avoids read-side contention, but does not protect pointer
traversals and, like hazard pointers, requires either full memory barriers
in read-side primitives, or inter-processor interrupts in update-side
primitives.
These schemes' shortcomings raise the question of
whether it is possible to do better.

This section introduces \emph{read-copy update} (RCU), which provides
an API that allows readers to be associated with regions in the source code,
rather than with expensive updates to frequently updated shared data.
The remainder of this
section examines RCU from a number of different perspectives.
\Cref{sec:defer:Introduction to RCU} provides the classic
introduction to RCU,
\cref{sec:defer:RCU Fundamentals} covers fundamental RCU
concepts,
\cref{sec:defer:RCU Linux-Kernel API} presents the Linux-kernel
API,
\cref{sec:defer:RCU Usage} introduces some common RCU use cases,
\cref{sec:defer:RCU Related Work} covers recent work related
to RCU,
\cref{sec:defer:RCU Exercises} provides some RCU exercises,
and finally
\cref{sec:defer:What About Updates?}
discusses updates.
