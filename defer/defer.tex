The strategy of deferring work goes back before the dawn of recorded
history. It has occasionally been derided as procrastination or
even as sheer laziness.
However, in the last few decades workers have recognized this strategy's value
in simplifying and streamlining parallel algorithms~\cite{Kung80,HMassalinPhD}.
Believe it or not, ``laziness'' in parallel programming often outperforms and
out-scales industriousness!
These performance and scalability benefits stem from the fact that
deferring work often enables weakening of synchronization primitives,
thereby reducing synchronization overhead.
General approaches work deferral include
reference counting (Section~\ref{sec:defer:Reference Counting}),
hazard pointers (Section~\ref{sec:defer:Hazard Pointers}),
sequence locking (Section~\ref{sec:defer:Sequence Locks}),
and RCU (Section~\ref{sec:defer:Read-Copy Update (RCU)}).
Finally, Section~\ref{sec:defer:Which to Choose?}
describes how to choose among the work-deferral schemes covered in
this chapter and Section~\ref{sec:defer:What About Updates?}
discusses the role of updates.
But first we will introduce an example algorithm that will be used
to compare and contrast these approaches.

\section{Running Example}
\label{sec:defer:Running Example}

This chapter will use a simplified packet-routing algorithm to demonstrate
the value of these approaches and to allow them to be compared.
Routing algorithms are used in operating-system kernels to
deliver each outgoing TCP/IP packets to the appropriate network interface.
This particular algorithm is a simplified version of the classic 1980s
packet-train-optimized algorithm used in BSD UNIX~\cite{VanJacobson88},
consisting of a simple linked list.\footnote{
	In other words, this is not OpenBSD, NetBSD, or even
	FreeBSD, but none other than Pre-BSD.}
Modern routing algorithms use more complex data structures, however, as in
Chapter~\ref{chp:Counting}, a simple algorithm will
help highlight issues specific to parallelism in an
easy-to-understand setting.

We further simplify the algorithm by reducing the search key from
a quadruple consisting of source and destination IP addresses and
ports all the way down to a simple integer.
The value looked up and returned will also be a simple integer,
so that the data structure is as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:defer:Pre-BSD Packet Routing List}, which
directs packets with address~42 to interface~1, address~56 to
interface~2, and address~17 to interface~7.
Assuming that external packet network is stable,
this list will be searched frequently and updated rarely.
In Chapter~\ref{chp:Hardware and its Habits}
we learned that the best ways to evade inconvenient laws of physics, such as
the finite speed of light and the atomic nature of matter, is to
either partition the data or to rely on read-mostly sharing.
In this chapter, we will use this Pre-BSD packet routing
list to evaluate a number of read-mostly synchronization techniques.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:defer:Sequential Pre-BSD Routing Table}
shows a simple single-threaded implementation corresponding to
Figure~\ref{fig:defer:Pre-BSD Packet Routing List}.
Lines~1-5 define a \co{route_entry} structure and line~6 defines
the \co{route_list} header.
Lines~8-21 define \co{route_lookup()}, which sequentially searches
\co{route_list}, returning the corresponding \co{->iface}, or
\co{ULONG_MAX} if there is no such route entry.
Lines~23-35 define \co{route_add()}, which allocates a
\co{route_entry} structure, initializes it, and adds it to the
list, returning \co{-ENOMEM} in case of memory-allocation failure.
Finally, lines~37-50 define \co{route_del()}, which removes and
frees the specified \co{route_entry} structure if it exists,
or returns \co{-ENOENT} otherwise.

This single-threaded implementation serves as a prototype for the various
concurrent implementations in this chapter, and also as an estimate of
ideal scalability and performance.
