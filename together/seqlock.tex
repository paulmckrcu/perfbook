This section looks at some special uses of sequence counters.

\subsection{Correlated Data Elements}
\label{sec:together:Correlated Data Elements}

Suppose we have a hash table where we need correlated views of two or
more of the elements.
These elements are updated together, and we do not want to see an old
version of the first element along with new versions of the other
elements.
For example, Schr\"odinger decided to add his extended family to his
in-memory database along with all his animals.
Although Schr\"odinger understands that marriages and divorces do not
happen instantaneously, he is also a traditionalist.
As such, he absolutely does not want his database ever to show that the
bride is now married, but the groom is not, and vice versa.
Plus, if you think Schr\"odinger is a traditionalist, you just
try conversing with some of his family members!
In other words, Schr\"odinger wants to be able to carry out a
wedlock-consistent traversal of his database.

One approach is to use sequence locks
(see \cref{sec:defer:Sequence Locks}),
so that wedlock-related updates are carried out under the
protection of \co{write_seqlock()}, while reads requiring
wedlock consistency are carried out within
a \co{read_seqbegin()} / \co{read_seqretry()} loop.
Note that sequence locks are not a replacement for RCU protection:
Sequence locks protect against concurrent modifications, but RCU
is still needed to protect against concurrent deletions.

This approach works quite well when the number of correlated elements is
small, the time to read these elements is short, and the update rate is
low.
Otherwise, updates might happen so quickly that readers might never complete.
Although Schr\"odinger does not expect that even his least-sane relatives
will marry and divorce quickly enough for this to be a problem,
he does realize that this problem could well arise in other situations.
One way to avoid this reader-starvation problem is to have the readers
use the update-side primitives if there have been too many retries,
but this can degrade both performance and scalability.
Another way to avoid starvation is to have multiple sequence locks,
in Schr\"odinger's case, perhaps one per species.

In addition, if the update-side primitives are used too frequently,
poor performance and scalability will result due to lock contention.
One way to avoid this is to maintain a per-element sequence lock,
and to hold both spouses' locks when updating their marital status.
Readers can do their retry looping on either of the spouses' locks
to gain a stable view of any change in marital status involving both
members of the pair.
This avoids contention due to high marriage and divorce rates, but
complicates gaining a stable view of all marital statuses during a
single scan of the database.

If the element groupings are well-defined and persistent, which marital
status is hoped to be,
then one approach is to add pointers to the data elements to link
together the members of a given group.
Readers can then traverse these pointers to access all the data elements
in the same group as the first one located.

This technique is used heavily in the Linux kernel, perhaps most
notably in the dcache subsystem~\cite{NeilBrown2015RCUwalk}.
Note that it is likely that similar schemes also work with hazard
pointers.

Another approach is to shard the data elements, and then have each update
write-acquire all the sequence locks needed to cover the data elements
affected by that update.
Of course, these write acquisitions must be done carefully in order to
avoid deadlock.
Readers would also need to read-acquire multiple sequence locks, but
in the surprisingly common case where readers only look up one data
element, only one sequence lock need be read-acquired.

This approach provides sequential consistency to successful readers,
each of which will either see the effects of a given update or not,
with any partial updates resulting in a read-side retry.
Sequential consistency is an extremely strong guarantee, incurring equally
strong restrictions and equally high overheads.
In this case, we saw that readers might be starved on the one hand, or
might need to acquire the update-side lock on the other.
Although this works very well in cases where updates are infrequent,
it unnecessarily forces read-side retries even when the update does not
affect any of the data that a retried reader accesses.
\Cref{sec:together:Correlated Fields} therefore covers a much weaker form
of consistency that not only avoids reader starvation, but also avoids
any form of read-side retry.

\subsection{Upgrade to Writer}
\label{sec:together:Upgrade to Writer}

As discussed in
\cref{sec:defer:RCU is a Reader-Writer Lock Replacement},
RCU permits readers to upgrade to writers.
This capability can be quite useful when a reader scanning an
RCU-protected data structure notices that the current element
needs to be updated.
What happens when you try this trick with sequence locking?

It turns out that this sequence-locking trick is actually used in
the Linux kernel, for example, by the \co{sdma_flush()} function in
\path{drivers/infiniband/hw/hfi1/sdma.c}.
The effect is to doom the enclosing reader to retry.
This trick is therefore used when the reader detects some condition
that requires a retry.
