The following sections discuss some important questions relating to
SMP programming.
Each section also shows how to {\em avoid} having to worry about
the corresponding question, which can be extremely important if
your goal is to simply get your SMP code working as quickly and
painlessly as possible --- which is an excellent goal, by the way!

Although the answers to these questions are often quite a bit less
intuitive than they would be in a single-threaded setting,
with a bit of work, they are not that difficult to understand.
If you managed to master recursion, there is nothing in here that should
pose an overwhelming challenge.

% @@@ doesn't parallel automatically make things faster? (locked increment)
% @@@ doesn't getting rid of locks get rid of all these problems? (atomic inc)
% @@@ doesn't NBS take care of all these problems? (cite IPDPS paper)
