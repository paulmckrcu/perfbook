1.	I have installed the Steel City Comic font referring to item 1
	in FAQ.txt, and rebuilt "perfbook.pdf". But it doesn't seem to
	have any effect. What am I missing?

	A.	If you built "perfbook.pdf" before installing the font,
		you need to rebuild cartoons whose sources are .svg
		files.  Typing "make touchsvg; make" will do the trick.

2.	I prefer perfbook-1c.pdf than perfbook.pdf to read it on my
	tablet. Typing "make perfbook-1c.pdf" every time is a little
	bit cumbersome. Isn't there any simpler way?

	A.	Actually there is!  Just type "make 1c".

3.	Are there other short name targets?

	A.	"make hb" will build perfbook-hb.pdf that is useful
		for making hard-bound printouts.
		"make 2c" will build perfbook.pdf.
		"make help" will show you the list of official targets.
		"make help-full" will display all the available targets.

4.	Isn't it possible to build perfbook-1c.pdf by just typing
	"make"?

	A.	Yes, it is!  Define an environment variable
		"PERFBOOK_DEFAULT" in your shell and set its value as
		"1c".  Then, just typing "make" will build
		perfbook-1c.pdf.
		If you set "hb" to "PERFBOOK_DEFAULT", typing "make"
		will build perfbook-hb.pdf mentioned in #3.
		While you have the environment variable set, specifying
		a specific target (or targets) always works.

5.	The Makefile cannot find pdflatex.  What is it and where can I
	find it?

	A.	The "pdflatex" package is a variant of Don Knuth's
		digital typesetting program, which you can install.
		Alternatively, you can use the container image described
		in #14 below.  Otherwise, instructions follow.

		On Ubuntu Xenial, installing the following set of
		packages suffices:

			texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra psutils
			texlive-publishers-doc texlive-fonts-extra
			texlive-math-extra texlive-publishers
			texlive-science texlive-bibtex-extra
			gnuplot-x11 xfig inkscape graphviz fig2ps

		Ubuntu Xenial has a buggy version of LaTeX package
		"titlesec". See #10 below to update.

		On Ubuntu Bionic and Focal, the following list should cover
		necessary packages (except for -doc packages):
			texlive-publishers texlive-pstricks
			texlive-science texlive-fonts-extra
			xfig inkscape graphviz fig2ps

		Ubuntu Bionic has a buggy version of LaTeX package
		"cleveref".  See #10 below to install the latest one.

		On Ubuntu Xenial and Bionic, you also need to fetch
		a version of a2ping which is compatible with updated
		Ghostscript. See #7 below.

		On Fedora, installing the following set of packages
		suffices:
			texlive-collection-plaingeneric
			texlive-collection-binextra
			texlive-collection-latexextra
			texlive-collection-fontsextra
			texlive-collection-fontutils
			fig2ps graphviz inkscape

		On other Linux distributions such as RHEL/CentOS and
		Scientific Linux, where support of TeX Live packages
		is insufficient, the aforementioned container image
		provides the needed support.  Again, see #14 below.

		Of course, you can install upstream TeX Live.
		See: https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html

		NOTE: In doing so, you might end up in having
			redundant texlive packages of your choice
			of distribution to satisfy dependency
			of other packages.

		Besides TeX Live, you need the following list of
		packages:
			fig2ps graphviz inkscape

6.	I cannot build perfbook, and the perfbook.log file complains
	about some obscure package being missing.  What do I do?

	A.	Please see #5 above.

7.	Building perfbook aborts with error "You need to update a2ping".
	What can I do?

	A.	a2ping 2.77p has become incompatible with up-to-date
		Ghostscript on most Linux distributions since September
		2018 due to security fixes backported from Ghostscript
		9.22 and later. a2ping 2.83p has lost compatibility with
		Ghostscript 9.50 due to a change in default behavior.
		A compatible a2ping (2.84p) is available at:

			https://www.ctan.org/pkg/a2ping

		Copy "a2ping.pl" as "a2ping" into a directory which
		precedes /usr/bin in your PATH setting.

		a2ping 2.84p is available in TeX Live 2020 or later
		(Including TeX Live 2019/Debian).

8.	When I try to build perfbook, it hangs after printing a line
	reading "pdflatex 1".  How can I fix this?

	A.	On UNIX-like systems, including Linux, type control-D.
		Then look at the end of the perfbook.log file (or the
		perfbook-1c.log file if you were building single-column).
		The error message at the end of the log file should
		indicate the source of the problem.

		The build scripts are supposed to make this unnecessary,
		so if it happens, please let me know.  Please send me the
		perfbook.log output (or perfbook-1c.log output, depending
		on which you were building) so that I can fix the scripts.

9.	Building perfbook or some of its experimental targets with
	alternative fonts fails due to a lack of font packages such as
	"nimbus15", "newtxtt", etc.; or an old version of font package
	"newtx".  How can I install or update them?

	A.	First of all, building perfbook requires TeX Live 2013/Debian
		(Ubuntu Trusty) or later. If you are told you have an old
		"newtx" package, you need to upgrade your TeX installation.
		For other optional font packages, upgrading TeX Live
		to 2015/Debian (Ubuntu Xenial) or later should suffice.

		Upgrading your Linux distribution (e.g. to Ubuntu Focal)
		is one way to upgrade TeX Live (to 2019/Debian on Focal),
		and might have many other benefits as well.

		However, on modern TeX Live, installing -fonts-extra consumes
		more than 1GB of your disk space. If you prefer to manually
		install individual packages on Ubuntu, refer to "Method 3" in:

			http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/73016/

		For font packages such as "newtxtt" and "nimbus15",
		you must also update font-map database. See:

			http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/88423/

		Following is a list of links to font packages perfbook
		depends on as of January 2020 which are not included
		in -fonts-recommended:

			https://www.ctan.org/pkg/newtx
			https://www.ctan.org/pkg/newtxtt
			https://www.ctan.org/pkg/nimbus15
			https://www.ctan.org/pkg/courier-scaled
			https://www.ctan.org/pkg/inconsolata
			https://www.ctan.org/pkg/newtxsf
			https://www.ctan.org/pkg/mdsymbol (for Fedora/CentOS)

	    Note 1: Manually installing a font package newer than the one
		already exists in your TeX installation is a tricky business
		and should be avoided unless you have a very good knowledge
		of the infamously complex TeX font system.  In most cases,
		upgrading TeX installation should be your way to go.

	    Note 2: Most font packages on the CTAN site provide .zip archives
		which will automatically put the files in a relatively
		right place. Note that font packages should be copied to the
		TEXMFLOCAL directory rather than to the TEXMFHOME directory.

	    Note 3: On Fedora and upstream TeX Live, you can install font
		packages one by one using the following command (example
		of newtx).

		On Fedora:
			sudo dnf install texlive-newtx

		On upstream TeX Live (assuming user mode installation):
			tlmgr install newtx

10.	Building perfbook fails with a warning of buggy cleveref/listings,
	version mismatch of titlesec/draftwatermark/epigraph/fvextra, or
	missing fvextra. What can I do?

	A.	They are known issues on Ubuntu Xenial (titlesec),
		Ubuntu Bionic (cleveref), TeX Live 2014/2015 (listings),
		TeX Live releases prior to 2015 (draftwatermark),
		TeX Live releases prior to 2017 (fvextra),
		and TeX Live releases prior to 2020 (epigraph).
		This answer assumes Ubuntu, but it should work on other
		distros.

	    1.	Download whichever package from CTAN mirror:
		http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/titlesec.zip
		http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/cleveref.zip
		http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/listings.zip
		http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/draftwatermark.zip
		http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/epigraph.zip
		http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/fvextra.zip

	    2.	Install it by following instructions at:
		https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LaTeX#Installing_packages_manually

11.	Is it possible to generate SyncTeX database file?

	A.	Yes, it is. Setting an environment variable:

		    $ export LATEX_OPT="-synctex=1"

		and doing "make clean; make" will generate
		perfbook.synctex.gz. This will enable SyncTeX search
		(.pdf <-> .tex) with a SyncTeX-supporting combination of
		pdf viewer and editor.

	    Notes:
	      -	For an introduction of SyncTeX search (gedit <-> evince), see:

		    https://help.gnome.org/users/evince/stable/index.html.en#synctex

		Other combinations of SyncTeX-supporting viewers and editors
		may work.

	      - You need to install gedit-plugins and enable SyncTeX plugin
		in gedit's preference.

	      - You need to open one of LaTeX sources (e.g. perfbook.tex)
		in gedit before doing inverse search from evince.

	      - The environment variable LATEX_OPT works for other build
		targets such as perfbook-1c.pdf, perfbook-hb.pdf, etc.
		To enable forward search from gedit, run e.g.:

		    $ utilities/synctex-forward.sh 1c

	      - Changes made by utilities/synctex-forward.sh can be
		reverted by running:

		    $ utilitied/synctex-forward.sh

		Please make sure to revert the changes before doing
		"git commit" of the other updates you've made.

12.	Figures of gnuplot in perfbook I built have their upper end
	trimmed.  What am I missing?

	A.	This is a known issue on Fedora as of November 2, 2019.
		Its Ghostscript (9.27) has regression in bounding box
		calculation. It has been fixed since in the upstream
		Ghostscript.

		    https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=700988

		Installing upstream Ghostscript 9.50 (or later) should
		work with you, but see #7 above to get a compatible a2ping.

		"make neatfreak; make" will rebuild all the figures.
		The "-jN" option should accelerate the rebuild.

	    Note:
		Fedora 32 has a fixed version of Ghostscript (9.52).

13.	After updating or installing texlive packages on Fedora,
	build fails with the message from bibtex saying:

		I found no \bibdata command---while reading file perfbook.aux
		I found no \bibstyle command---while reading file perfbook.aux

	Is there any workaround?

	A.	Try rebuilding database files by the following commands:

		    sudo updmap-sys --syncwithtrees --force
		    sudo updmap-sys

14.	I want a stable environment to build perfbook.pdf.
	Can't I just use some container image?

	A.	You can find a template Dockerfile under the docker/
		subdirectory.  You can pull the container image built from
		it as follows:

		    docker pull akiyks/perfbook-build-focal:latest

		It can be run with the command:

		    docker run --rm -it -v <path to perfbook dir>:/work \
		      akiyks/perfbook-build-focal:latest

		Note:
		The prebuilt container image assumes <uid:pid> = <1000:1000>.
		If you have different IDs, you can still run the image by
		adding the option:

		     -u $(id -u):$(id -g)

		to the "docker run" command.  The bash prompt will be in the
		form of "I have no name!@abcdef012345:/work$".	Builds of
		perfbook will nevertheless succeed.  You can also build
		a container image of your own:

		    cd docker
		    docker build -t <container image tag> \
		      --build-arg uid=$(id -u) --build-arg gid=$(id -g) .

		For those prefer a Fedora-based container image,
		akiyks/perfbook-build-fedora:latest is also available.
		It is built from docker/Dockerfile.fedora.

		If you have podman already installed, you can run the image
		with podman. podman maps container's root to your host uid
		by default.
		Use the following command to run:

		    podman run --rm -it -v <path to perfbook dir>:/work:z \
		      -u 0:0 akiyks/perfbook-build-fedora:latest

		You will see a prompt with a "#".
		Your updates under /work will have your host uid in host's POV.
